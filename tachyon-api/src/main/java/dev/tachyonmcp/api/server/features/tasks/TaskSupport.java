 *
 * <p>MCP 2025-11-25 lets the client opt in per call via the legacy {@code tools/call.task} field:
 * {@link #FORBIDDEN} rejects a task-augmented call, {@link #REQUIRED} rejects a plain (non
 * task-augmented) call, and {@link #OPTIONAL} accepts either. MCP 2026-07-28 (SEP-2663) has no
 * client-requested opt-in — that legacy field is ignored — so only {@link #REQUIRED} has an
 * effect there: it always creates a task (the tool can never run synchronously), gated on the
 * client having declared the {@code io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks} extension for that request.
 * {@link #OPTIONAL} and {@link #FORBIDDEN} both run synchronously under 2026-07-28.
